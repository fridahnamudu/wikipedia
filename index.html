                <p><strong>Bernard A. Maguire</strong>(February 11, 1818 â€“ April 26, 1886) was a <div class="church">Catholic priest</div> and Jesuit who twice served as 
                    the president of Georgetown University. Maguire emigrated with his family from Ireland to Maryland at the age of six, where he studied under the Jesuits
                     at Saint John's College, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1837. He then continued his education at Georgetown University, where he eventually became 
                     a teacher and prefect. As prefect, Maguire was responsible for quelling an uprising of 40 students who were unhappy with rules over the meeting times of 
                     the Philodemic Society. In 1852, he became the president of Georgetown University, and oversaw the partial separation of the preparatory division from the 
                     college. He left in 1858 to do pastoral work, but returned as president in 1866. Maguire directed the university's rebuilding after the Civil War and the 
                     establishment of the law school. His tenure ended in 1870, and he spent the rest of his life in pastoral ministry. (Full article...)</p>
